I am a PhD student in the Department of Economics at the University of Essex. My research focuses on issues of labour, education and family economics. During my PhD studies, I visited the European Central Bank as part of the Price-Setting and Microdata Analysis Research network (PRISMA). I also worked as a consultant for the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).
